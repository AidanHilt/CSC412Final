//  Lab 07 Solution - Part 1
//	
//	In this program, I review some stuff that you are going to need for the
//	rest of the semester, concerning lists, vectors, pointers, and iterators.
//	As usual, the two lab sessions unfolded completely differently.  This code
//	is mostly a cleanup of what we discussed in the Thursday session.
//
//	Note:  In what follows, I use the capitalized word List as a generic term
//	to refer to what could be implemented as an STL vector/list/deque.

	//	Summary:  What have we learned so far
	//	First, it is possible to have multiple lists/vectors that refer to the same
	//	data without duplicating the data.  One list/vector List can contain the actual
	//	data while the other(s) contain pointers to the data.
	//	Second, My dual list/vector is silly, only one "full" List should ever be used.
	//	Partial Lists (e.g. "selected objects") are fine, but be careful about object
	//	removal (what's coming next)
	

	//	CAVEAT:  There is one big danger with multiple lists that refer to the
	//	same data:  What happens if data is removed from one of the lists?
	//
	//	1. If an object is removed from dataL?
	//		dataL.remove(*(dataL.begin()));
	//	then dataV[0] becomes a dangling pointer (points to an object that doesn't
	//	exist anymore).  We need to remove the pointer from dataV (and evenDataL).
	//	However, removing elements from a vector is cumbersome and inefficient, so
	//	don't do it.
	//	So...
	//	What type of List should you use?
	//	When dealing with data set of moderate size (up to tens of thousands of elements)
	//		o if elements are never removed or added --> arrays
	//		o if elements can only be added or removed at the tail --> vector
	//		o if elements can only be added or removed at the head or tail --> deque
	//		o otherwise, list
	//
	//	...which brings up the issue of erase vs. remove
	//	remove works by value:  take out all elements of the List whose value match
	//							the one passed as argument
	//	erase works with an iterator or a range of iterators
	//	Note that std::vector only supports erase (but does it inefficiently anywhere
	//	other than the tail of the vector.  Similarly, std::deque only supports erase
	//	(but does it inefficiently anywhere other than the head or tail of the deque.

	//	In what follows, I assume that my vector dataV never existed and that I only
	//	have my "full" list dataL and the partial list of selected objects evenDataL;
	
	//	Let's say that I want to remove the head element from the master List
	//	First, get the pointer to this element (we will need it for evenDataL)
	list<MyStruct>::iterator targetIt = dataL.begin();
	MyStruct* targetPtr = &(*targetIt);
	
	//	Remove the pointer from the lists of pointers evenDataL.  If the pointer
	//	doesn't belong to that list, this does nothing.
	evenDataL.remove(targetPtr);
	// and now remove the object from the master list
	dataL.erase(targetIt);

	cout << "Lists after removal 1" << endl;
	cout << "-------------------------" << endl;

	cout << "List form" << endl;
